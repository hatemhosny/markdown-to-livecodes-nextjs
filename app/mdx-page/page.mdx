# MD(X) to LiveCodes

Markdown and MDX code blocks can be easily converted to interactive LiveCodes playgrounds.
See [docs](https://livecodes.io/docs/markdown-to-livecodes) for details.

This code block is rendered as a LiveCodes playground:

```jsx livecodes className="playground"
import { useState } from "react";

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

To have similar interactive playgrounds from Markdown code blocks,
go to [docs](https://livecodes.io/docs/markdown-to-livecodes) to get started.
